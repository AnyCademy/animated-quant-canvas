## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Test the New Pages (Ready Now!)

Navigate to these URLs in your application:

```
http://localhost:5173/instructor/earnings
http://localhost:5173/admin/payouts
```

### 2. Configure Platform Settings

Update your platform Midtrans credentials in the database:

```sql
UPDATE platform_settings 
SET setting_value = '{
  "client_key": "YOUR_PLATFORM_MIDTRANS_CLIENT_KEY",
  "server_key": "YOUR_PLATFORM_MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY",
  "is_production": false,
  "is_active": true
}'
WHERE setting_key = 'midtrans_config';
```

### 3. Switch to Platform Payment Processing

Replace the current `PaymentPage` with `PlatformPaymentPage` in your course enrollment flow.

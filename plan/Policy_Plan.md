# 3. Instructor-Centric Payment Model

## Model Overview
Unlike traditional platforms that aggregate payments, this implementation uses an instructor-centric approach where:

- Each instructor creates their own Midtrans merchant account
- Instructors configure their own payment credentials in the platform
- Payments flow directly to instructor's Midtrans account
- Platform tracks transactions but doesn't handle money flow
- Instructors receive settlement directly from Midtrans

## Benefits of This Approach
| Benefit | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Reduced Platform Risk | No money flow through platform | Lower regulatory burden |
| Direct Settlement | Instructors get paid directly | Faster instructor payments |
| Individual Control | Each instructor manages their rates/terms | Higher instructor satisfaction |
| Compliance Simplification | Midtrans handles PCI-DSS per instructor | Reduced platform compliance costs |
| Scalability | No centralized payment bottleneck | Easy horizontal scaling |

## Instructor Onboarding Process

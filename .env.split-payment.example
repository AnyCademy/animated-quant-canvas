# HOW SPLIT PAYMENT WORKS
# ================================
# 
# 1. When a student buys a course for 100,000 IDR with 10% platform fee:
#    - Total charged to student: 100,000 IDR
#    - Platform receives: 10,000 IDR (10%)
#    - Instructor receives: 90,000 IDR (90%)
#
# 2. The payment is processed through the platform's main Midtrans account
# 3. The system tracks the split amounts in the database
# 4. You can implement automatic transfers to instructors or manual payouts
#
# 5. If split payment is disabled or conditions aren't met:
#    - Payment goes directly to instructor's Midtrans account
#    - No platform fee is collected
#
# ================================
# PRODUCTION SETUP
# ================================
# For production, change the following:
# - Set VITE_PLATFORM_MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION=true
# - Use production Midtrans credentials (start with "Mid-" instead of "SB-Mid-")
# - Update VITE_MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION=true for fallback settings
# - Test thoroughly with small amounts first

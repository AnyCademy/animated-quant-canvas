## ⚡ Next Steps

### 1. **Run Database Migration**
Execute the SQL script in Supabase:
```bash
database_remove_instructor_midtrans.sql
```

### 2. **Configure Platform Midtrans**
Update platform settings with your Midtrans credentials:
```sql
UPDATE platform_settings 
SET setting_value = '{
  "client_key": "YOUR_PLATFORM_CLIENT_KEY",
  "server_key": "YOUR_PLATFORM_SERVER_KEY",
  "is_production": false,
  "is_active": true,
  "disbursement_enabled": true
}'
WHERE setting_key = 'midtrans_config';
```

### 3. **Test Payment Flow**
- Test course payments using platform credentials
- Verify revenue split calculations
- Test disbursement to instructor bank accounts
